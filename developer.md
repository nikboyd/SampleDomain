### Discussion

There are potentially several kinds of [developers](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/developer.md).
A [developer](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/developer.md) generally develops (or guides, or manages the development of) software [solutions](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/solution.md).
Sometimes their responsibilities (and thus their interests) are combined in a single person or role within an organization.
