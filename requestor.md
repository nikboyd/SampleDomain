There are potentially several kinds of [requestors](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/requestor.md).
A [requestor](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/requestor.md) generally oversees and requests [improvements](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/improvement.md) in some [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/business.md) [activity](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/activity.md)(s),
or they may have specific domain knowledge and expertise.
They also ensure that the conduct of [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/business.md) [activities](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/activity.md) remain in alignment with the purposes of the [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/business.md),
