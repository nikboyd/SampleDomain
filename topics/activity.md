### Discussion

A [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/business.md) accomplishes its [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/mission.md) in the world through its activities.
As such, its activities need to be kept in alignment with the purposes of a [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/business.md), and the
qualities associated with those activities warrant measurement in order to manage and improve their conduct.

The activities of a [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/business.md) can be broadly categorized as those that are [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/mission.md) critical, [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/mission.md) central,
and [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/mission.md) peripheral, depending on whether and how the activities are related to the overall [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/business.md) [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/mission.md) and [vision](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/vision.md).
Even though peripheral to its [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/mission.md), some activities are supportive and essential, and thus still required to
accomplish the [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/business.md) [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/mission.md).

For example, a [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/business.md) of nearly any size will require human re[sources](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/source.md), and specific regulatory policies
will be in place within a legal framework for appropriately hiring and firing employees.
So, while the activities associated with employee management may not be considered a [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/mission.md) critical [component](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/component.md)
of the [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/business.md), the associated issues will still require address and may warrant some level of automation
through some software [solution](https://github.com/nikboyd/sample-domain/blob/master/topics/solution.md)(s).
