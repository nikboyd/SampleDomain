### Discussion

A [Business][business] accomplishes its [Mission][mission] in the world through its activities.
As such, its activities need to be kept in alignment with the purposes of a [Business][business], and the
qualities associated with those activities warrant measurement in order to manage and improve their conduct.

The activities of a [Business][business] can be broadly categorized as those that are [Mission][mission] critical, [Mission][mission] central,
and [Mission][mission] peripheral, depending on whether and how the activities are related to the overall [Business][business] [Mission][mission] and [Vision][vision].
Even though peripheral to its [Mission][mission], some activities are supportive and essential, and thus still required to
accomplish the [Business][business] [Mission][mission].

For example, a [Business][business] of nearly any size will require human re[Sources][source], and specific regulatory policies
will be in place within a legal framework for appropriately hiring and firing employees.
So, while the activities associated with employee management may not be considered a [Mission][mission] critical [Component][component]
of the [Business][business], the associated issues will still require address and may warrant some level of automation
through some software [Solution][solution](s).
