### Discussion

A software [Solution][solution] solves some specific (kinds of) problem(s).
Problems typically involve multiple elements from the real world (where they are situated).
Thus, a problem can usually be decomposed into several [Component][component] elements, and these [Components][component]
are often represented in the structure of the software [Solution][solution].

Because software [Solutions][solution] intend to enable or improve the conduct of some [Business][business] activities,
most software [Solutions][solution] provide some kind of user experience for collecting, manipulating, and
presenting information, whether using a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or a mobile device
(phone, tablet, etc.). Some of the software [Components][component] surface these user experiences through [Dialogs][dialog].
The [Dialogs][dialog] engage users in conversations (of a kind) for collecting, manipulating, and presenting information.
