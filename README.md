A Conceptual Model for Software Requirements
==========================================================

This natural conceptual model is a representative sample derived from the one described more fully 
[here](http://educery.com/papers/models/requirements.htm#model.diagram).


Overview
========

	 <p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="vision.html">Vision,</a> <a href="mission.html">mission</a> and <a href="value.html">values</a> articulate
		the intended ends of a business and the acceptable means for reaching those
		ends. <a href="purpose.html">Purposes</a> align business
		<a href="activity.html">activities</a> with the business <a href="mission.html">mission</a> and <a href="vision.html">vision.</a> Business
		<a href="activity.html">activities</a> fulfill a business
		<a href="purpose.html">purpose</a> and further a business towards its
		objectives. Business <a href="activity.html">activities</a> often have
		opportunities for (measurable) <a href="improvement.html">improvements.</a>
		Software solution <a href="feature.html">features</a> support and improve
		business <a href="activity.html">activities.</a> <a href="dialog.html">Dialogs</a> reveal solution features and domain information
		models. Software <a href="component.html">components</a> surface
		<a href="dialog.html">dialogs</a> and conduct conversations with software
		solution <a href="expector.html">users.</a> Solution requirements knowledge and
		descriptions originate with some official (or unofficial) <a href="source.html">sources.</a> </p> 
	 <p align="JUSTIFY"> The relationships between <a href="stakeholder.html">stakeholders,</a> <a href="source.html">sources,</a>
		and their knowledge can be modeled and depicted graphically. The following
		diagram shows selected, representative portions of such a natural conceptual
		model. A key to the notation used in this model diagram can be found in
		<a href="#notation">Appendix A.</a> Descriptions of the essential model
		elements can be found in the linked pages, both through the foregoing textual hyperlinks and
		through links contained in the following model diagram.</p>
