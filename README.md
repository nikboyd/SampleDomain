### A Conceptual Model for Software Requirements

This natural conceptual model is a representative sample derived from the one described more fully 
[here](http://educery.com/papers/models/requirements.htm#model.diagram).


### Overview

<a href="topics/vision.md">Vision,</a> <a href="topics/mission.md">mission</a> and <a href="topics/value.md">values</a> articulate
		the intended ends of a business and the acceptable means for reaching those
		ends. <a href="topics/purpose.html">Purposes</a> align business
		<a href="topics/activity.html">activities</a> with the business <a href="topics/mission.html">mission</a> and <a href="topics/vision.html">vision.</a> Business
		<a href="topics/activity.html">activities</a> fulfill a business
		<a href="topics/purpose.html">purpose</a> and further a business towards its
		objectives. Business <a href="topics/activity.html">activities</a> often have
		opportunities for (measurable) <a href="topics/improvement.html">improvements.</a>
		Software solution <a href="topics/feature.html">features</a> support and improve
		business <a href="topics/activity.html">activities.</a> <a href="dialog.html">Dialogs</a> reveal solution features and domain information
		models. Software <a href="topics/component.html">components</a> surface
		<a href="topics/dialog.html">dialogs</a> and conduct conversations with software
		solution <a href="topics/expector.html">users.</a> Solution requirements knowledge and
		descriptions originate with some official (or unofficial) <a href="topics/source.html">sources.</a>

The relationships between <a href="topics/stakeholder.html">stakeholders,</a> <a href="topics/source.html">sources,</a>
		and their knowledge can be modeled and depicted graphically. The following
		diagram shows selected, representative portions of such a natural conceptual
		model. A key to the notation used in this model diagram can be found in
		<a href="#notation">Appendix A.</a> Descriptions of the essential model
		elements can be found in the linked pages, both through the foregoing textual hyperlinks and
		through links contained in the following model diagram.
